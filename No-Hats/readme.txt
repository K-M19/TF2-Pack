Features:
This will remove almost all cosmetic items and make every character revert to their default appearance regardless of what they’re wearing. It will not affect weapons or their appearance, only remove the external cosmetic layers.


Note:
(Personally, I won’t use it since I prefer having a fun experience.)

If you want faster resource loading, delete the "No-Hats-SRC" folder and keep only "No-Hats.vpk".
