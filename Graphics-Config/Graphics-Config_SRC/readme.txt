Graphics-Config was created by https://github.com/mastercomfig
It is fully compatible with all configuration setups, and you can add image quality adjustment features at:
~ \steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg\overrides\modules.cfg

You can also find more details here: https://docs.comfig.app/latest/customization/custom_configs/

I have also added tweaks, fixed some existing bugs, and optimized it for my Ultra-Low-Graphics mod.

Recommended launch options:
-novid -nojoy -particles 1 -nohltv -nosteamcontroller -precachefontchars +sv_allow_point_servercommand always

This mod works best when combined with Ultra-Low-Graphics.
