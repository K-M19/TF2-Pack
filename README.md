# TF2-FixPack
* **This is a mod library that includes various mods to improve gameplay experience, upgrade visuals, and slightly boost FPS.**
* **All mods are open-source, so you can suggest changes or add your own tweaks to suit your personal needs.**

> [!NOTE]
>  If you want faster resource loading, I recommend using the mod versions reformatted as .VPK available [here](https://github.com/K-M19/TF2-Pack/releases/tag/Main)


| Mods | Features |
| --- | ------ |
| Graphics-Config | Boost FPS |
| Ultra-Low-Graphics | Optimizes graphics and performance by removing certain textures, making the visuals cleaner.  |
| No-Hats  | This will remove almost all cosmetic items and make every character revert to their default appearance regardless of what they’re wearing. It will not affect weapons or their appearance, only remove the external cosmetic layers |
| Viewmodel-FixPack  | Fixes Viewmodel issues when using viewmodel_fov above 90, such as funny bugs and glitches (e.g., Spy’s and Soldier’s “mystery arms”). This mod fixes all Viewmodel-related errors. |
| Visual-FixPack  | A visual overhaul pack to make it look more stable and appealing. |
| Clean-Conscientious-Objector  | Rebuilding the material makes the Conscientious Objector look cleaner. |
