Features:
Fixes Viewmodel issues when using viewmodel_fov above 90, such as funny bugs and glitches (e.g., Spy’s and Soldier’s “mystery arms”). This mod fixes all Viewmodel-related errors.

Note:
If you want faster resource loading, delete the "Viewmodel-FixPack-SRC" folder and keep only "Viewmodel-FixPack.vpk".
