Features:
Optimizes graphics and performance by removing certain textures, making the visuals cleaner.

Note:
If you want faster resource loading, delete the "Ultra-Low-Graphics-SRC" folder and keep only "Ultra-Low-Graphics.vpk".

This mod works best when combined with graphics optimization configs.
